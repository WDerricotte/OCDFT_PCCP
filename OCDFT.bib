The influence of functional, solvation, and relativistic effects on the calculated energies and intensities has been examined by correlation of the calculated parameters to experimental data on a series of 10 iron model complexes, which span a range of high-spin and low-spin ferrous and ferric complexes in Oh to Td geometries. Both quadrupole and dipole contributions to the spectra have been calculated. We find that good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained by using the {BP}86 functional with the {CP}({PPP}) basis set on the Fe and {TZVP} one of the remaining atoms. Inclusion of solvation yields a small improvement in the calculated energies. However, the inclusion of scalar relativistic effects did not yield any improved correlation with experiment. The use of these methods to uniquely assign individual spectral transitions and to examine experimental contributions to backbonding is discussed.},

	abstract = {We explore the utility of density-functional theory ({DFT}) in conjunction with the transition-potential ({TP}) method to simulate x-ray-absorption spectra. Calculations on a set of small carbon-containing molecules and chemisorbed species show that this provides a viable option for obtaining excitation energies and oscillator strengths close to the experimental accuracy of core-valence transitions. Systematic variations in energy positions and intensities of the different spectra in the test series have been investigated, and comparison is made with respect to the static exchange-, self-consistent-field, and explicit electron-correlation methods. The choice between standard exchange-correlation functionals is shown to be of little consequence for the valence resonant, here π*, parts of the x-ray-absorption spectra, while the long-range behavior of presently available functionals is found not to be completely satisfactory for Rydberg-like transitions. Implementing a basis set augmentation technique, one finds that {DFT} methods still account well for most of the salient features in the near-edge x-ray-absorption spectra, save for the multielectron transitions in the near continuum, and for some loss of Rydberg structure. For clusters modeling surface adsorbates, the {DFT} transition potential method reproduces well the spectral compression and intensity reduction for the valence level absorption compared to the free phase, provided fairly large clusters are taken into account. While for near-edge x-ray-absorption fine-structure ({NEXAFS}) spectra of free molecules the {DFT}-{TP} and Hartree-Fock/static exchange methods have complementary advantages, the {DFT}-{TP} method is clearly to be preferred when using clusters to simulate {NEXAFS} spectra of surface adsorbates.},

By using the appropriate portions of Hartree-Fock exchange for core and valence regions separately, {CV}-B3LYP overcomes the disadvantages of {BHHLYP} and B3LYP, which give inferior descriptions of valence and core excitations, respectively. Density functional theory({DFT}) calculations with the {CV}-B3LYP functional reproduce core- and valence-orbital energies close to those of {BHHLYP} and B3LYP, respectively. Time-dependent {DFT} calculations with the {CV}-B3LYP functional yield both core- and valence-excitation energies with reasonable accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recently, we have proposed an efficient method in the Kohn?Sham density functional theory ({DFT}) to study systems with a constraint on their density (Phys. Rev. A 2005, 72, 24502). In our approach, the constrained state is calculated directly by running a fast optimization of the constraining potential at each iteration of the usual self-consistent-field procedure. Here, we show that the same constrained {DFT} approach applies to systems with multiple constraints on the density. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we focus on the study of long-range charge-transfer ({CT}) states. We show that constrained {DFT} is size-consistent:? one obtains the correct long-range {CT} energy when the donor?acceptor separation distance goes to infinity. For large finite distances, constrained {DFT} also correctly describes the 1/R dependence of the {CT} energy on the donor?acceptor separation. We also study a model donor?(amidinium?carboxylate)?acceptor complex, where experiments suggest a proton-coupled electron-transfer process. Constrained {DFT} is used to explicitly calculate the potential-energy curves of both the donor state and the acceptor state. With an appropriate model, we obtain qualitative agreement with experiments and estimate the reaction barrier height to be 7 kcal/mol.},

	abstract = {Analytic energy gradients for the orbital-optimized second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory ({OMP}2) are presented. The {OMP}2 method is applied to difficult chemical systems, including those where spatial or spin symmetry-breaking instabilities are observed. The performance of the {OMP}2 method is compared with that of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory ({MP}2) for investigating geometries and vibrational frequencies of the cis-{HOOH}+, trans-{HOOH}+, {LiO}2, C 3 + , and {NO}2 molecules. For harmonic vibrational frequencies, the {OMP}2 method eliminates the singularities arising from the abnormal response contributions observed for {MP}2 in case of symmetry-breaking problems, and provides significantly improved vibrational frequencies for the above molecules. We also consider the hydrogen transfer reactions between several free radicals, for which {MP}2 provides poor reaction energies. The {OMP}2 method again exhibits a considerably better performance than {MP}2, providing a mean absolute error of 2.3 kcal mol−1, which is more than 5 times lower than that of {MP}2 (13.2 kcal mol−1). Overall, the {OMP}2 method seems quite helpful for electronically challenging chemical systems such as symmetry-breaking molecules, hydrogen transfer reactions, or other cases where standard {MP}2 proves unreliable. For such systems, we recommend using {OMP}2 instead of {MP}2 as a more robust method with the same computational scaling.},

	abstract = {A tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate triphenylmethylthiolate Cu({II}) model complex (1) that reproduces structural and spectroscopic features of active sites of blue Cu proteins is characterized using low-temperature absorption, magnetic circular dichroism ({MCD}), X-ray absorption ({XAS}), and resonance Raman ({rR}) spectroscopies combined with {DFT} calculations to define its electronic structure. The electronic structure of 1 is further related to the oxidized Cu site in plastocyanin. The key spectral differences relative to plastocyanin include an increase in the intensity of the S pπ ? Cu {CT} band and a decrease in the absorption intensity at ?450 nm. The energies of d ? d transitions in 1 decrease relative to plastocyanin, which reflects the more tetrahedral geometry of 1. S K-edge {XAS} measurements demonstrate a more covalent thiolate interaction in the {HOMO} of 1 (52\% S p) than in plastocyanin (38\% S p). The effects of the high thiolate covalency on the absorption and Raman spectral features for 1 are evaluated. Additional changes in the absorption spectrum of 1 relative to plastocyanin in the ?450 nm and the near-infrared regions are due to differences in the electronic structure of the nitrogen ligands associated with the change from imidazole to pyrazole. Finally, {XAS} measurements at the Cu L- and K-edges indicate that the effective nuclear charge of Cu in 1 is higher than in plastocyanin, which likely results from misdirection of the ligating orbitals in the constrained tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate ligand system. This reduces the donor interaction of this ligand with the copper which increases the covalency of the thiolate?Cu bond and can contribute to the electron-transfer properties of the blue copper site.},

	abstract = {For chemically accurate excited state energies, one is forced to include electron?electron correlation at a level of theory significantly higher than configuration interaction singles ({CIS}). Post-{CIS} corrections do exist, but most often, if they are computationally inexpensive, these methods rely on perturbation theory. At the same time, inexpensive variational post-{CIS} methods would be ideal since modeling electronic relaxation usually requires globally smooth potential energy surfaces ({PESs}) and there will inevitably be regions of near electronic degeneracy. With that goal in mind, we now present a new method entitled variationally orbital adapted {CIS} ({VOA}-{CIS}). On the one hand, we show that in the ground-state geometry, {VOA}-{CIS} performs comparably to {CIS}(D) at predicting relative excited state energies. On the other hand, far beyond {CIS}(D) or any other perturbative method, {VOA}-{CIS} correctly rebalances the energy of charge-transfer ({CT}) states versus non-{CT} states, while simultaneously producing smooth {PESs}?including the important case of avoided crossings. In fact, through localized diabatization of {VOA}-{CIS} excited states, one can find a set of reasonable diabatic states modeling {CT} chemical dynamics. After significant benchmarking, we are now confident {VOA}-{CIS} and {VOA}-{CIS}-like methods should play a major role in future excited state calculations.},

These auxiliary bases are slightly more than three times larger than orbital bases of split valence quality. Compared to non-approximated treatments, computation times for the Coulomb part are reduced by a factor of ca. 8 for def2-{SV}(P) orbital bases, ca. 25 for def2-{TZVP} and ca. 100 for def2-{QZVPP} orbital bases.},

Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of {CT} states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the {CT} state is not reproduced by {TDDFT} employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the {TDDFT} equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state {DFT} calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in {TDDFT} arising through the electron transfer in the {CT} state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree?Fock or exact Kohn?Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of {TDDFT} and configuration interaction singles ({CIS}) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin?bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll?spheroidene complex, in which {CT} states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of {TDDFT} alone for the {CT} states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study of the relationship between interatomic distances and the spectral positions of valence‐ and K‐shell σ* photoionization resonances is reported for a selected series of molecules. Three‐dimensional graphical representations of the occupied and virtual‐valence σ‐symmetry orbitals of these compounds reveal their striking similarity to the wave functions of a particle in a cylindrical well, substantiating qualitative notions long employed in free‐electron molecular orbital ({FEMO}) approximations. Accordingly, the molecular potential along the symmetry axis in these compounds is modeled after a finite square well, with a depth approximately equal to the energy of the lowest σ‐symmetry valence molecular orbital and a width determined from analogies to {FEMO} theory. Calculated minimal‐basis‐set molecular‐orbital energies for both occupied and virtual states are seen to correlate accurately with the simple square‐well energy level formula (π2 /2)(n 2/l 2 ) when measured in Hartree atomic units from the bottom of the well. The calculated σ* orbital energies are furthermore in excellent agreement with experimentally and theoretically determined valence‐shell photoionization resonance positions, the latter consequently also satisfying the square‐well correlation formula. A similar situation obtains for experimentally and theoretically determined K‐shell resonance positions, although energy shifts from minimal‐basis values are evident in these cases. These circumstances are clarified quantitatively on basis of Feshbach–Fano considerations, in which minimal‐basis‐set virtual‐valence σ* orbitals play the roles of zeroth‐order states subject to modification by interactions with nonresonant background continua. Concluding remarks contrast and compare molecular‐orbital and square‐well approaches to photoionization resonances with those based on multiple‐scattering and barrier models. The present results appear to clarify the origins of recently reported empirical correlations of bond lengths with resonance positions, and help to determine their range of applicability.},

	abstract = {The theoretical description of core‐excitation spectra presents a difficult problem due to the large excitation energies involved, and the extensive relaxation effects that occur upon promotion of a core electron to a valence or Rydberg level. For this reason we follow a two‐step procedure to evaluate core‐excitation energies. We start from a coupled cluster singles‐doubles ({CCSD}) description of the core ion to include the large relaxation effects, followed by adding an extra electron to the core‐ionized state to obtain the various core‐excited states of the neutral by using the open‐shell electron attachment equation‐of‐motion coupled cluster method ({EA}‐{EOMCC}). An important feature of the approach is that the term values, the core‐excitation energies relative to the relevant core‐ionization potential, are calculated directly and this allows us to achieve high accuracy. This work describes the extension of the {EA}‐{EOMCC} method to open‐shell reference states and we make applications to a number of molecular systems. The assignment of recently obtained high‐resolution core‐excitation spectra for acetylene and ethylene is discussed, and we compare our open‐shell {EA}‐{EOMCC} results to results obtained from closed‐shell {EA}‐{EOMCC} calculations based on the equivalent core ion corresponding to the core‐excited molecular system. Special attention is paid to the singlet–triplet splitting for core‐excited states, and we address the multireference character of core‐ionized and core‐excited states for molecules that contain symmetry‐equivalent heavy nuclei, which relates to a persistent controversy in the literature concerning localized versus delocalized core holes.},

	abstract = {We report a novel scheme for computing electronic excitation energies within the framework of density functional theory ({DFT}) based on a time-independent variational formulation of {DFT}. The excited state density functional is recast as a Kohn?Sham functional, which is further simplified by an adiabatic approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. Under the adiabatic approximation, the minimization of the excited state Kohn?Sham functional is shown to be equivalent to a ground state {DFT} computation augmented with orthogonality constraints with respect to the ground state Kohn?Sham determinant. An algorithm for the optimization of the energy subject to orthogonality constraints, which does not suffer from variational collapse, is described and implemented. A benchmark test set containing 28 organic molecules ( Schreiber, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110 ) was used to assess the quality of the excitation energies obtained. Two novel approaches to spin-adapt the resulting excitation energies are discussed and found to provide results with error metrics similar to those of time-dependent {DFT}. Similarities and differences with respect to other time-independent {DFT} approaches are highlighted and some of the advantages of our scheme?including the ability to correctly describe charge-transfer excitations?are critically assessed.},

	abstract = {The constrained density functional theory–configuration interaction ({CDFT}-{CI}) method has previously been used to calculate ground-stateenergies and barrier heights. In this work, it is examined for use in computing electronic excited states, for the challenging case of conical intersections. Conical intersections are a prevalent feature of excited electronic surfaces, but conventional time-dependent density functional theory calculations are found to be entirely unsatisfactory at describing them, for two small systems. {CDFT}-{CI} calculations on those systems are found to be in qualitative agreement with reference {CAS} surfaces. These results suggest that with a suitable definition of atomic populations and a careful choice of constrained states, {CDFT}-{CI} could be the basis for a seamless description of electronic degeneracy.},

	abstract = {In this work we highlight the potential of {NEXAFS}?near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure?analysis to perform refinements of hydrogen-bond structure in {DNA}. For this purpose we have carried out first-principle calculations of the N1s {NEXAFS} spectra of the guanine and cytosine nucleobases and their tautomers, nucleosides, and nucleotides in the gas phase, as well as for five crystal structures of guanine, cytosine, or guanosine. The spectra all clearly show imine (π1*) and amine (π2*) nitrogen absorption bands with a characteristic energy difference (?). Among all of the intramolecule covalent connections, the tautomerism of hydrogens makes the largest influence, around ±0.4?0.5 {eV} change of ?, to the spectra due to a switch of single?double bonds. Deoxyribose and ribose sugars can cause at most 0.2 {eV} narrowing of ?, while the phosphate groups have nearly negligible effects on the spectra. Two kinds of intermolecule interactions are analyzed, the hydrogen bonds and the stacking effect, by comparing ?compressed? and ?expanded? models or by comparing models including or excluding the nearest stacking molecules. The shortening of hydrogen-bond length by 0.2?0.3 Å can result in the reduction of ? by 0.2?0.8 {eV}. This is because the hydrogen bonds make the electrons more delocalized, and the amine and imine nitrogens become less distinguishable. Moreover, the hydrogen bond has a different ability to influence the spectra of different crystals, with guanine crystals as the largest (change by 0.8 {eV}) and the guanosine crystal as the smallest (change by 0.2 {eV}). The stacking has negligible effects on the spectra in all studied systems. A comparison of guanosine to guanine crystals shows that the sugars in the crystal could create ?blocks? in the π-and hydrogen bonds network of bases and thus makes the imine and amine nitrogens more distinguishable with a larger ?. Our theoretical calculations offer a good match with experimental findings and explain earlier discrepancies in the {NEXAFS} analysis.},
